**An Inquiry into the Ideological Foundations and Timeless Brilliance of Business** that is currently `under development`.

This book is an attempt to analyze the concept of business (both in terms of acts of business and of business institutions) in light of my suspicion that many of the world's societies have entrusted business institutions with responsibilities that they were not made to support, such as those of sustaining life or supporting peoples' livelihoods.

This book will also include an analysis of my suspicion, rather than assuming that the suspicion is true.

I am, however, primarily motivated to write and develop this work because I am worried that my suspicion is true, as, if it is true, many of the world's societies would have vulnerabilities that they have created, and I hope that if I can sufficiently argue for the presence and cause of these vulnerabilities, they may be more readily patched/resolved.

<!-- Like using flipflops as shoes in your everyday life then one day needing to run away from a bear. Those flipflops will fail you and possibly hold you back during the time when you need help, not for something to hold you back or make you more vulnerable.

The United States may be one of the most business-dominated and business-sustained societies in the world, so if there are these weaknesses at the root of business, there is a weakness within the U.S.'s ability to continue on as it is, to grow, and to improve. -->

In the end, this book should present a greater argument for the need for more open sourced works and free software, and for the inspiring of greater interests in sustainability, permaculture, homesteading, and the perception of one's gifts and blessedness.
