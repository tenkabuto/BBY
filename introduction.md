# Introduction

Rules and expectations of a thing tend to be established according to and while within certain conditions.
If it is found that the conditions that gave rise to the original rules/expectations have changed,
    we ought to consider whether these rules/expectations ought to be changed/replaced with some more relevant rules or expectations.

<!--

It may be helpful for us to consider not merely that 'business' itself ought to be changed because conditions are such that business as we know it is not fit to operate within them (the conditions). [IOW: Our conception of business may not be universally changed/challenged]
    Rather, we should consider whether, in particular cases, our application of our rules and expectations for business/businesses is in error because particular actions or institutions that seem/appear business-y are occuring outside of the conditions under which those rules and expectations were formed or which those rules and expectations should be correctly/rightfully applied.

-->

In the case of business, the rules/expectations of business were likely codified in the early, entrepreneurial stages of doing business [the act].

* Particularly that of the ability to fail sans obligations to employees and the surrounding communities
    * Originally the burden of risk was merely shouldered by businesses' [the institution] founders,
        * Which has commonly (traditionally?) been given as a reason for why founders of a business enterprise should be able to take a larger share of 'their' enterprise's profits[^1]
        * It may be that as an endeavor continues, risk is diffused away from the founders (the amount of risk that they shoulder is reduced), so the share of profits that are given to the founder should be reduced and in turn distributed to other parties that are involved with the enterprise



[^1]: Does not necessarily make these practices legitimate, but it sorta makes these practices _seem_ legitimate (to some).
