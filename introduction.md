# Introduction

Rules and expectations of a thing tend to be established according to and while within certain conditions, and we ought to consider whether these rules/expectations ought to be changed/replaced with some more relevant rules or expectations if it is found that the conditions that gave rise to the original rules/expectations have changed.

In the case of business, the rules/expectations of business were likely codified in the early, entrepreneurial stages of doing business [the act].

* Particularly that of the ability to fail sans obligations to employees and the surrounding communities
    * Originally the burden of risk was merely shouldered by businesses' [the institution] founders,
        * Which has commonly (traditionally?) been given as a reason for why founders of a business enterprise should be able to take a larger share of 'their' enterprise's profits[^1]
        * It may be that as an endeavor continues, risk is diffused away from the founders (the amount of risk that they shoulder is reduced), so the share of profits that are given to the founder should be reduced and in turn distributed to other parties that are involved with the enterprise


[^1]: Does not necessarily make these practices legitimate, but it sorta makes these practices _seem_ legitimate (to some).
